# Web-Scraping
Python scraper
This is a simple scarpe tool that was used in google colab. some websites do not necessarily allow the use of these crawlers 
but with those that do, this scrape tool is a great and simple tool that can help you retrieve 
most of the information you're looking to scrape.

what i wuould like in the near future is to incorporate more lines of code that allow access to some tags that
were difficult to scrape and to be able to omit non important details.
